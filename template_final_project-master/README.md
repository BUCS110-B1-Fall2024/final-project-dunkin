## Project Description
This game challenges players to click on bread, donuts, knives, forks, and gifts to adjust their score. Bread and donuts must be clicked to gain points and prevent automatic deductions over time. The true excitement lies when bread and donuts are no longer available, leaving only knives, forks, and the gift. Will you take the safe route of losing just 1 or 2 points, or risk it all by clicking the gift, which could either add or subtract 5 points? Itâ€™s a game that highlights the thrill of making strategic choices.
